## Introduction

Welcome to the NativeScript Getting Started Guide. Using this guide, you'll be able to learn about NativeScript, a cross-platform library written in JavaScript that allows developers to build mobile apps leveraging native APIs for iOS and Android. NativeScript is a project built by Telerik. 

### What is this?

This guide will help you get up and running with a NativeScript-built mobile app. We'll walk through creating a mobile app step by step. This guide is not a replacement for reading the [docs](http://docs.nativescript.org), but is designed to help you learn how to build mobile apps using NativeScript.

### What you're building
