Welcome to the [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org) Getting Started Guide. Using this guide, you'll use NativeScript, a cross-platform JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps, to build an iOS and Android app from scratch.

### What you're building

A groceries-management app that does the following things:

- Allows users to register and login.
- Allows authenticated users to add and delete groceries from a list.
- Connects to RESTful services.
- Runs cross-platform—i.e. iOS and Android.
- Runs cross-device—i.e. phones and tablets.

This guide will walk you through building an app that meets these requirements and more. If you follow along to the end here's what the finished app looks like on iOS:
