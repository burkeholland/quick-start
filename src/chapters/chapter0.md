Welcome to the [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org) Getting Started Guide. Using this guide, you'll use NativeScript, a cross-platform JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps, to build an iOS and Android app from scratch.

### What you're building

Here's the premise: your boss has tasked you with creating the next great grocery management app. You're given some designs from your design team, a few HTTP endpoints from your back end team, and you're told to build an app that does the following things:

- Allows users to register and login.
- Allows authenticated users to add and delete groceries from a list.
- Connects to your companies' existing RESTful services.
- Meets your design team's “native” mockups.
- Runs cross-platform—i.e. iOS and Android.
- Runs cross-device—i.e. phones and tablets.

This guide will walk you through building an app that meets these requirements and more. If you follow along to the end here's what the finished app looks like on iOS:

And here's what the app looks like on Android:

By building “Groceries“ you'll see just how easy and fun it is to build iOS and Android apps with NativeScript. Let's get started.
