## Introduction

Welcome to the NativeScript Getting Started Guide. Using this guide, you'll be able to learn about NativeScript, a cross-platform library written in JavaScript that allows developers to build mobile apps leveraging native APIs for iOS and Android. NativeScript is a project built by Telerik.

### What is this?

This guide will help you get up and running with a NativeScript-built mobile app. We'll walk through creating a mobile app step by step. This guide is not a replacement for reading the [docs](http://docs.nativescript.org), but is designed to help you learn how to build mobile apps using NativeScript.

### What you're building

We're going to walk you through building a Grocery List app called "Groceries". This app will include: 

- Backend services integration
- Registration
- Login
- Ability to add to, edit, and delete groceries from list

This app is going to look awesome on your iPhone 4s, 5, and 6, your iPad 2, and your Android devices. We're building a cross-platform app so if you add groceries on your iPhone, you should be able to see them if you login to your Nexus. It's going to look like a native app to satisfy the design team's requirements, but it will be written in a manner that facilitates cross-platform development so that with one codebase you can support multiple screens.

Bored with creating yet another Todo app to learn about a new programming language or framework? So are we. That's why we created this awesome Grocery List app project for you to build. No more forgetting the baking soda right when you have a craving for snickerdoodles. With the Groceries App, you'll be able to make your trip to Stop 'n' Shop that much easier.

Here's what this app will look like by the time we're finished with it:
