## Introduction

Welcome to the [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org) Getting Started Guide. Using this guide, you'll use NativeScript, a cross-platform JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps, to build an iOS and Android app from scratch.

### What you're building

Bored with creating yet another to-do app to learn about a new programming language or framework? So are we. That's why we added a small twist to revolutionize the to-do-list-app-as-a-means-to-learn-a-technology space—grocery management! With the rather unoriginally titled [“Groceries” app](https://github.com/tjvantoll/groceries), you'll no longer have to worry about forgetting the baking soda right when you have a craving for snickerdoodles.

Here's the full premise: your boss has tasked you with creating the next great grocery management app. It's totally going to make your company millions. You're given some designs from your design team, a few HTTP endpoints from your backend team, and you're told that the app must do the following things:

- Allow users to register and login.
- Allow authenticated users to add and delete groceries from a list.
- Connect to your companies' existing RESTful services.
- Meet your design team's “native” mockups.
- Run cross-platform—i.e. iOS and Android.
- Run cross-device—i.e. phones and tablets.

This guide will walk you through building an app that meets these requirements and more. If you follow along to the end here's what the finished app looks like on iOS:

And here's what the app looks like on Android:

By building “Groceries“ you'll see just how easy NativeScript makes building iOS and Android apps—and fun too! Let's get started.
