This is a quick-start guide for building [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org) CLI apps. View the guide live at <http://nativescript.github.io/quick-start/>.

## Contributing

The content of this site is stored in markdown files in the [src/chapters folder](https://github.com/tjvantoll/nativescript-quick-start/tree/gh-pages/src/chapters). Change those files with your markdown editor of choice and send a pull request.

If you'd like to see the content rendered in the site itself, start by installing the site's npm dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

And then run `gulp`:

```
$ gulp
```

Gulp starts up a development server and launches the quick-start guide in it. Gulp also watches for changes to files in the src folder (including the chapter Markdown files), and refreshes the site in your browser automatically.
